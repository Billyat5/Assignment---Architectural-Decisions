Selection of Data Storage Strategy

**Status**

Accepted

**Context**

Data storage, retrieval, and management of user profiles, ride history, and payment information in the app need to be managed efficiently and securely. A solid and reliable system is required that can handle the function effectively.

**Decision**

A hybrid data storage model using both SQL and NoSQL databases will be adopted. On the one hand, for SQL databases, PostgreSQL will be used for straightforward and structured data like user and driver profiles, and ride histories due to its capability of handling structured data schemas. On the other hand, for the NoSQL database, MongoDB will be implemented for data with more variety and complexity such as transaction data, which requires a more flexible data storage option.

The hybrid model rather than using only SQL or NoSQL is chosen due to its flexibility and scalability. Different types of data can be managed in a situation that best suits their nature, thus optimizing performance and utilization. If only SQL database is considered, it might lead to limited scalability of data as SQL database may not scale horizontally as efficiently as NoSQL databases. If only the NoSQL database is considered, the database might not strictly comply with atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties, especially when managing transactional data.

**Consequences**

A hybrid model allows the benefits of both SQL and NoSQL databases to be utilized, where different data structures and data types can be managed effectively. Thus, data can be organized properly and easily retrieved when needed. 

However, managing dual databases might add complexity to data management and require expertise in facilitating and optimizing two separate database systems. Developers need to be meticulous and skilled to maintain seamless interoperability between the two systems and ensure that data security is upheld during transactions as well as data migrations between the two databases. While managing a hybrid system presents its own set of challenges, the overall benefits regarding flexibility, scalability, and data integrity make it a suitable selection for the app’s evolving requirements.
