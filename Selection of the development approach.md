Selection of the development approach

**Context**

The transportation company’s mobile app requires a development framework that can manage real-time location updates, secure payment transactions, and provide an excellent user interface to ensure its requirements are fulfilled. Some key features of the app include real-time tracking, a responsive map interface, secure transactions, and robust security. A selection of the app development framework must be carefully made to ensure the app is reliable and secure, as well as provide a seamless user experience, fulfilling both business requirements and user needs.

**Decision**

A Native app development approach will be selected as it is developed for specific platforms (iOS or Android). Native apps can grant access to device features and allow integration of platform-specific functionalities such as geolocation services, push notifications, and secure payment integrations that can fulfill the keys of our app’s requirements and optimize its performance as well as enhance user experience.

The web app is not considered due to the lack of deep integration with device features such as GPS or the notification system that our app requires. In addition, when compared to native apps, web app performance is generally poorer when providing fast user experiences such as real-time location tracking and updates. Moreover, web apps generally don’t work offline or have limited functionality without the internet. While hybrid apps can be used across both Android and iOS platforms from a single code base, they might face more complexity and bugs when dealing with cross-platform functions like secure transactions or real-time tracking compared to native apps.

**Consequences**

Opting for a native app approach might lead to several consequences regarding resources and maintenance. First, native development often implies writing specific codebases for each platform (iOS and Android), which can be resource-heavy due to the need for platform-specific expertise. Moreover, application updates, regular maintenance, bug fixes, and feature rollouts across each platform lead to an additional layer of complexity, as separate deployments and possibly multiple troubleshooting would be needed. 

Despite the nature of native app maintenance and development is resource-intensive, it is deemed crucial for achieving an optimized, secure, and reliable user experience. Prioritizing user experience and the app’s requirement being fulfilled over cost will also lay a solid foundation for decision-making as the app continues to develop. By ensuring that the app performs well and meets both user needs and business goals, a stable and robust platform for the app’s functionalities and features can be built upon.
