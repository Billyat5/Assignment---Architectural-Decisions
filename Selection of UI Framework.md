Selection of UI Framework

**Status**

Accepted

**Context**

As the mobile app will serve various users, apart from its functionalities, the UI framework needs to provide a visually appealing, intuitive, and responsive interface that enhances user experience. One of the important requirements of the app, the map interface needs to be taken into consideration in the UI framework as well, as users will need to navigate maps smoothly, select routes, and interact with the location-based features. Therefore, the selection of a UI framework is of utmost importance, ensuring that both the company’s business requirements and user needs can be met.

**Decision**

React Native for the UI framework is recommended due to its popular and wide usage as well as strong community support from developers, which is crucial for debugging and exploring creative and innovative solutions undergoing app development. It is also a cross-platform development framework, which allows a codebase to be used in both Android and iOS platforms, leading to time and resource efficiency. In comparison, other frameworks like Swift for iOS or Kotlin for Android require a separate codebase and two different development tracks.

Moreover, React Native can create smooth and high-quality user interfaces, which is critical for mobile apps that require real-time updates and responsive map navigation. Furthermore, it has an extensive library with strong community support, where a large and active community provides a wide variety of pre-built components, in-depth documentation, and knowledge for troubleshooting or debugging. These are the edges that other frameworks do not have, such as Flutter or Xamarin, which are not as commonly used as React Native.

**Consequences**

Despite the decision to select react native enables efficient cross-platform development and maintenance, it might require developers to have specific knowledge and expertise in React Native for optimal implementation. As React Native continues to develop rapidly, continuous training programs might also be needed for developers to keep up with the latest functions and features of React Native. Updates of React Native would also need to be monitored closely to ensure app proficiency.

However, adopting React Native as the app UI framework can ensure that the app is a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, which is of utmost importance. The app across various platforms will have a consistent look, and the components are highly customizable, which allows developers to make changes during different stages of development. The flexibility that React Native provides can enhance the development process and make appropriate adjustments in response to user feedback and market changes, ensuring the app can obtain high user satisfaction.
