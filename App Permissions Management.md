**Title**

App Permissions Management

**Status**

Accepted

**Context**

Proper management of various permissions is crucial to ensure security and privacy. Several permissions of the app include accessing user personal data, such as live location, user contact details, and allowing the app to send notifications. As the app will require a push notification system such as ride confirmations and driver updates, it is critical to gain user agreement before sending out notifications. The importance of obtaining user permissions and showing understanding to users is key to both business requirements and user experience. Furthermore, the role of effective authentication and authorization systems play a dominant role in managing user access and permissions across various functionalities and levels of data access. 

**Decision**

The principle of least privilege will be adopted, which refers to granting only the necessary permissions that the app requires to function properly. For information that is not required, the app will not ask for access. Moreover, a clear and transparent user permission request describing why each permission is needed will be explained to users, ensuring that the users clearly understand before accepting that permission. The permission request shall explain clearly why permission is needed, what data will be obtained, how it will be used etc. By doing so, users can understand thoroughly and will have a sense of control when using the app, which can strengthen the user experience. Implicit consent, where the app assumes it was granted user permission for some non-important data without asking for permission would erode user trust and potentially violate data protection regulations, is therefore not considered.

In addition, the app will employ a dynamic authentication and authorization system that ensures user access management securely. A versatile permission system will be implemented to guarantee user identity validation (Authentication) and secure, role-based data and feature access (Authorization). Considering user privacy and transactions within the app, a single-factor authentication system may not be appropriate and might expose the app and its data to risks and vulnerabilities.

**Consequences**

The approach to obtaining permissions can gain the trust of users, ensuring that users feel safe and secure while using the app. The transparent and minimal approach toward accessing user data can further foster a positive user experience. 

On the other hand, developers need to ensure data protection regulations are met and need to handle various user permission scenarios. For instance, users might deny certain permissions, therefore developers would require detailed planning in advance to cope with different situations that might occur. Thorough testing with different scenarios needs to be conducted to ensure smooth usage of the app and its functionality is not hindered. While this might mean more complicated development and testing phases, the result in gaining user trust and maintaining business requirements is considered valuable, as it can align both business requirements and user needs.
