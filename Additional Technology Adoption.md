Additional Technology Adoption

Proposed

**Context**

To further enhance the functionality and user experience of the mobile app, it is pivotal to evaluate any additional frameworks or technologies that should be added and integrated. For this app, it is of paramount importance that users can get a quick and accurate update about their ride information such as driver location, preferred routes, estimated arrival times, etc. Push Notification systems such as important announcements and driver updates should also be incorporated to actively update users.

**Decision**

WebSocket technology to facilitate real-time bi-directional communication between the client and server is proposed. WebSocket is known for its capacity to provide uninterrupted data transfer, which ensures that users can receive real-time updates regarding location tracking and route changes etc without requiring the user to refresh. This technology further enables app users to consistently sync with the most updated and latest ride information, which enhances user experience as timely and accurate ride information is provided.

Alternative technologies like Server-Sent Events (SSE) and long polling are not considered due to the following reasons. First, SSE is only capable of sending data one-way, from the server to the client, thus not able to establish a communication channel between server and client. In addition, long polling technology needs more server resources and is not as efficient as WebSocket as there can be a delay in communication. Considering various perspectives, WebSocket technology is the preferred option due to its strong capabilities in establishing a dynamic, low-latency communication channel, that fits precisely with the mobile app in real-time.

**Consequences**

While WebSocket allows for robust real-time functionality and enables a dynamic user interface, it might require extra server resources to manage the connections effectively. In addition, to manage and deploy WebSocket appropriately, especially during high concurrent usage, specific expertise or professionals are suggested to manage the technology to ensure stable connectivity and prevent data loss. Hence training or recruiting relevant professionals might be required, which leads to an increase in cost. Moreover, to avoid potential security vulnerabilities during data transmission, it requires meticulous planning and execution.
